        So lace up your shoes-<br>
        Xtacy'19, the annual fest of the department of engineering and technology, jamia millia islmia, gives you the opportunity to bridge the gap and show your potential in Bridge Building Arena
        <br>
        Participating students get to experience what it is to be an engineer, designing structures to a set of specifications and then see them perform their function!<br>
        <br>
        
        Rules:<br>
        A team must have 2 members. <br>
        Teams are required to report an hour prior to the event.<br>
        Teams are to construct bridges using only popsicle sticks, glue, tooth picks, and dental floss and other recycled products.<br>
        <br>
        Bridges are to be judged on aesthetics and originality of design, presentation, ultimate load carrying capacity, strength-to-weight ratio, and predicted failure point.<br>
