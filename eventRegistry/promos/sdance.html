        "The job of feet is walking, but their hobby is dancing."<br>
        We all love losing ourselves to the rhythm of the music some or the other time, don't we?<br>
        That's the only time we forget about how we showcase ourselves to the world, and actually become who we really are. That's what dancing can do to a person.<br>
